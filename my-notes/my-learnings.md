- 3 layer Architecture: Client <--> Controller <--> Service <--> DAO <--> DB
- Add new rest API end point flow:
  - DAO Layer
    - Add entity class
    - Add respository class
  - Service Layer
    - Define Interface
    - Implementation
  - Controller Layer
    - Controller class that has all the end points defined
- Can add custom exceptions
- DTO objects
  - Generated for communication between client and server
- Custom Response
  - Default API response can be overridden by creating custom response objects
- Exception Handler
  - In case of exception, API response has some default information like timestamp, status code, exception trace, message, API endpoint etc.
  - This response can be customized as per client requirement by adding exception handler. 
- Hibernate Validator for bean validation
  - For create and update APIs, input provided by user in the request body can be validated as per client requirement using field annotations provided by ```javax.validation.constraints```.
  - We can also provide ```message``` for each annotation to be displayed in case the user input validation fails.
